## How to Contribute to the `contributors.mdx` File on GitHub

Follow these steps:

**1. Install Git:**

   If you haven't installed Git on your computer, download and install it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

**2. Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Enter the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XIAOAssembly/xaio-dao
   ```

**3. Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate into the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd xiao-dao
   ```
   Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**4. Create a Feature Branch:**

   Each issue should be worked on in a separate branch. Create a new branch for your issue:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b issue-yourname-introduction
   ```
   Replace `yourname` with your actual name.

**5. Update the `contributors.mdx` File:**

   Open the `contributors.mdx` file in your preferred text editor. Add your information in the following format:

   ```markdown
   - ![Your Name](link-to-your-image)
     - Name: Your Name
     - URL: [Your Website or Profile](link-to-your-website-or-profile)
     - Introduction: A brief introduction about yourself
   ```
   Replace `Your Name`, `link-to-your-image`, `link-to-your-website-or-profile`, and `A brief introduction about yourself` with your actual details.

**6. Commit Your Changes:**

   After adding your information, save your changes and close the file. Stage your changes:

   ```bash
   git add contributors.mdx
   ```
   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added introduction for Your Name"
   ```
   Replace `Your Name` with your actual name.

**7. Push Your Changes:**

   Push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin issue-yourname-introduction
   ```
   Replace `yourname` with your actual name.

**8. Create a Pull Request:**

   Go to the [repository page on GitHub](https://github.com/XIAOAssembly/xaio-dao/i). Click on "Pull requests", then "New pull request". Select your branch from the dropdown menu and click "Create pull request". Add any additional details if necessary, then click "Create pull request" again.

After you've created your pull request, a repository maintainer will review your changes. If everything is correct, they will merge your changes into the main branch. If changes are needed, they will leave feedback in the pull request.

Happy coding!
